# OmniFocus Bible Reading Plan

This is a modified version of [Joe Buhlig's Bible Reading Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/master/Bible%20Reading%20Plan/README.md) with links to bible.com (YouVersion) added.

Copy and past the taskpaper file into OmniFocus.

There is also a file for readings for one year of the Revised Common Lectionary, which is a regular, three-year rotation.
