# OmniFocus Bible Reading Plan

This is a modified version of [Joe Buhlig's Bible Reading Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/master/Bible%20Reading%20Plan/README.md) with links to bible.com (YouVersion) added.

Copy and past the taskpaper file into OmniFocus.

If you want to adjust the dates, the easies way I've found is either with multiple cursors in Sublime Text or with a Find and Replace for the year.
